# Real-Time Video Analysis with AI

Welcome to the **Real-Time Video Analysis** project! üé•ü§ñ This project leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to analyze video content for **facial expressions**, **posture detection**, and **hand gesture analysis**. Built with **MediaPipe**, **Groq**, **Whisper**, and **OpenCV**, this tool is designed to provide real-time insights into non-verbal communication during video streams.

## üöÄ Features

- **Facial Expression Recognition**: Analyze facial landmarks and expressions in real-time.
- **Posture Detection**: Evaluate posture based on pose estimation.
- **Hand Gesture Analysis**: Identify hand movements and gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for fast inference using **Groq** acceleration.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribe spoken words with **Whisper**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **[MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)**: A framework for building cross-platform ML pipelines, used for face and pose detection.
- **[Groq](https://groq.com/)**: AI acceleration to speed up inference and make real-time processing possible.
- **[Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)**: OpenAI‚Äôs speech-to-text model used to transcribe speech in the video.
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)**: Computer vision library to capture and manipulate video frames.

## ‚ö° How It Works

1. **Input Video**: The video is captured and processed frame by frame.
2. **Face Expression Recognition**: Using **MediaPipe**, we extract facial landmarks and analyze expressions.
3. **Pose Estimation**: Evaluate posture using **MediaPipe Pose**.
4. **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Identify hand gestures via **MediaPipe Hands**.
5. **Real-Time Feedback**: The system provides feedback on **confidence**, **nervousness**, and **hand gestures**.
6. **Speech-to-Text**: **Whisper** transcribes any spoken words in the video.

## üìù Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-video-analysis.git
cd real-time-video-analysis
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scriptsctivate'
```

### 3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```
